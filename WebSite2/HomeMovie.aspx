        AfterBurner Media can transfer your home movies to DVD FROM the following formats:
        <ul><li>8mm silent</li>
            <li>Super 8mm silent* </li>
            <li>16mm silent & sound film</li>
        </ul> 
        
        Price includes analog to digital conversion, DVD authoring (menu creation & indexing), simple one color text label, & thin/clear case.<br />
        <i>*Please note:  ABM cannot transfer 8mm sound film at this time.</i><br />
        <br />
        ABM places up to 120 minutes (2 hours) of home movies per DVD. This retains the highest possible quality for your movies.  "Squeezing" more than 120 minutes on a DVD requires higher compression, resulting in a loss of playback quality.
        <br />
        <br />

        <b>Additional Options:</b><br />
        <b>1) Royalty-free background music</b> can be added to your silent movies.  This makes viewing your DVDs much more interesting and enjoyable. Over 100 titles to choose from! Cost: additional $0.15/foot.<br />
        <b>2) Video correction.</b> This is especially nice if the film has deteriorated through the years.  ABM always recommends this for film that is over 15 years old. Cost: additional $0.10/foot. 
        <br />
        <b>3) A full color, photo quality label</b> can be placed on your DVDs.  Cost:  additional $3 per DVD.<br />
        <b>4) Additional copies</b> of your DVD(s) can be purchased. The cost is $6/DVD with simple one color text label, and $9/DVD with color photo label.  For example, if your final project requires 3 DVDs, then the cost for one additional set would be $18 with simple label and $27 with color photo label.<br />
        <b>5)</b> In the process of transfering your movies  to DVD, they are converted to a <b>digital file format</b> - usually .AVI, that can be viewed and edited on a computer, or .MPEG that can be uploaded to social media sites. When the project is done, ABM can can copy these files to a DVD-rom, flash drive or portable hard drive that you provide.  Cost:  $3.00 per file.<br />
