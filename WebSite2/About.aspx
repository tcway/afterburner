            Since 2006 AfterBurner Media has specialized in the conversion and transfer of older media to newer, more accessible digital media formats.  
            This includes media such as:
        <ul>
            <li>Silent 8mm home movies & Silent/sound 16mm home movies</li> 
            <li>All formats of video cassette tapes</li>
            <li>Audio cassette tapes (micro and standard formats)</li>
            <li>Audio reel to reels</li>
            <li>Photos</li> 
            <li>35mm Slides</li>
            <li>Vinyl records</li>
            <li>Laser video discs</li>
            <li>DAT (digital audio tape), and More</li>
        </ul>  

        <p>
            To enjoy these forms of media, most require older technology that may not be readily available to you today.  
           AfterBurner Media can convert and transfer your older media to newer digital formats that will help preserve it for future generations.  
           Custom memory videos can be created from existing photos, movies and videotapes for events such as weddings, graduations, special programs, vacations and family gatherings.

        <ul>
            <li>Along with media conversion and transfer, we also offer disc duplication and printing.</li>  
            <li>Labels are custom designed and can include simple text in a single color, or full color photos with multi-color text.</li>  
            <li>Our labels are printed directly to the disc, not stuck on with a sticky label that can come off in the future.</li>  
            <li>Our labels are guaranteed to never come off!  If you have a CD or a DVD you want to copy, (copyright restrictions apply) we can help!  
            Whether you want 5 copies or 100 copies, you’ll find competitive pricing and prompt service.</li>
        </ul>
