        This category of media includes digital photos, photo prints, 35mm slides & 35mm negatives. 
        If you are like me, you take hundreds of digital photos every month. 
        Whether you take pictures with the small camera on your cell phone or a
        <br />
        15 mega-pixel SLR professional camera, you still have the problem of what to do with all the photos! 
        If you are normal, you dump your photos on your home computer, look at them once, and then forget about them. 
        You probably don't have them organized, and you probably don't have them backed up. 
        It only takes a common hard drive failure to rob you of your valuable photo collection...something that is irreplaceable!!! 
        This only has to happen to you once before you take photo storage and back up seriously!<br />

    </p>
