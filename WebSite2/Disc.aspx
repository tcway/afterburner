    <b>The following discs can be duplicated:</b>
    <p>- DVD-R: data/video/audio</p>
    <p>- CD-R: data/audio/video  </p>

        You provide the master DVD or CD disc. Custom designed full color labels are printed onto the disc (no stickers to come off in your player!). 
        From text to photos to full color graphics and special effects...we do it all! Your discs will look great whether it's one copy or 500! We cannot provide jewel case paper insert printing. 
        The only printing we do is on the disc itself. For more information, read How AfterBurner Media Does It below.

        All discs are copied to high quality JVC/Taiyo Yuden hub-printable (white matte finish) CD-R or DVD-R discs.

        <b>How AfterBurner Media Does It!</b><br />
        <br />

        AfterBurner Media uses the Microboards QD-DVD-127 DVD Duplicator allowing us to duplicate 7 DVDs or CDs at a time allowing us to quickly turn around your project.<br />
        <br />

        AfterBurner Media also uses the Rimage 2000i automated digital duplication and printing system.
  This computer based system can duplicate and print up to 100 discs at a time with no user intervention.
  Using robotics, the discs are loaded into it's drive bays for duplication and/or printing.
  The unit employs high quality Plextor PX-716A, 8X DVD/CD optical drives, the Rimage 480i Thermal Inkjet Printer, HP's PhotoREt IV, and ColorSmart III print technology.
        <br />
        <br />

        ABM uses high quality JVC-Taiyo Yuden blank media (CD-R/DVD-R).
  These disks are fully printable from edge to center hub and come with a high quality white matte finish embedded into the disc (no stickers to gum up your CD or DVD players!).
  The white matte finish provides a high quality printing surface that will last for years to come.
  The HP 480i printer is capable of photo quality custom printing on the entire surface of the disc (printed case jackets and shrink wrapping are not available).<br />
