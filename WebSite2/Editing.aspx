        ABM can help you with your audio and video projects. We 
        cannot record your event. However, once you have your source
        material, we can edit it to create powerful presentations just 
        the way you want them.

        <b><u>Pricing:</u></b><br />
        Because every project is unique, pricing for projects requiring 
    audio and/or video editing are set by one of the following:<br />

        <b>- Hourly Rate</b> - $19.50/hour<br />


        <b>- Project Rate</b> - A one time, total fee set once the project 
    requirements are specified.<br />
        <br />

        <b>NOTE:</b>   ABM reserves the right to decide which pricing rate will
            be used for any project.<br />
    </p>

        <b><u>Additional Options:</u></b><br />

        <b>1) A full color, photo quality label </b>can be printed directly on
your your DVDs (not a sticker label). Cost:  additional $3 per 
DVD.  Project cost includes simple, one color label and a thin,
clear disc case.<br />

        <b>2) Additional copies</b>
        The cost is $5/CD & $6/DVD with simple one color text label,
and $8/CD & $9/DVD with full color photo label.  For example, 
if your final project requires 3 CDs, then the cost for 1 
additional set would be $15 with simple labels and $24 with 
color photo labels.  Likewise, if your final project requires 3
DVDs, then the cost for 1 additional set would be $18 with 
simple labels and $27 with color photo labels.
